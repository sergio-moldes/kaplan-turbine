# Kaplan Turbine Design

## Project Description

This project involves the design and analysis of a Kaplan-type turbine, which includes the sizing and analysis of the necessary parameters for the design of the runner, distributor, draft tube, and spiral casing. A CAD design has been created, and CFD simulations have been carried out to verify the performance of the design.

## Technologies Used

- **3D Modeling**: SolidWorks
- **Technical Documentation**: AutoCAD

## Repository Contents
